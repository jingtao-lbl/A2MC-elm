description: Run Phase 6 (REFINEMENT) of the A2MC calibration workflow as the offline agent — the human-in-the-loop analog of the orchestrator's `_run_refinement()` / `reasoning.interpret_results()` + `extract_lesson()`. Evaluate the experiment results vs baseline + expected outcomes, extract lessons (discoveries / failed approaches), update Adaptive Memory, and decide convergence — converged, rethink (6→3), or redesign (6→0). Use when the user says "evaluate the results", "did the experiment work", "extract the lessons", "run Phase 6", "should we converge or iterate", "what did we learn", after Phase 5 testing.

# Phase 6: Refinement (offline agent)

The offline analog of `_run_refinement()`. Online, `reasoning.interpret_results()` +
`extract_lesson()` evaluate and learn automatically; **offline, YOU do both** — judge the experiment
honestly against expectation, name the mechanism you learned, and decide where the loop goes next.

> **Floor, not ceiling.** The online agent classifies confirmed/partial/rejected and picks the next
> phase. As the offline agent you can do the deeper work the loop can't: a full equifinality /
> cross-regime analysis (`scientific-analysis`), a manuscript figure, reconciling this result with
> prior rounds (`compare-calibration-rounds`), or deciding a finding is worth curating into the KB.
> Evaluate at least as rigorously as the online agent, then reason past it.

**Critical mode difference — the memory write gate.** The online agent runs Memory in **propose**
mode (stages to `auto_discovered_pending.json`, cannot write curated knowledge). **You, the offline
agent, are the disposer** — you write curated knowledge directly (interactive mode) and you promote
the online agent's staged proposals. "Online proposes, offline disposes." This is *the* thing Phase 6
does differently offline.

**Inputs (from Phase 5):** experiment results (per-target metrics, extraction status) + the Phase 4
expected outcomes. **Deliverable:** honest per-hypothesis verdict, lessons written to Memory, a
convergence decision.

## Step 1 — evaluate the results (reads existing experiment results — no new simulations)

`phases/phase6_refinement/evaluate_results.py` compares each experiment to expected outcomes and to
the Phase 2 baseline → outcome class (SUCCESS / PARTIAL / MARGINAL / FAILED), best experiment,
targets met.

> **Footgun — data-reliability gate.** A *silent* extraction failure (no error, empty metrics) reads
> as 0/6 targets and looks like a real FAILED result. Confirm `extraction_status == "extracted"` AND
> non-empty metrics AND no `error` before trusting any outcome — otherwise you contaminate the KB
> with a phantom failure.

## Step 2 — interpret + extract lessons (you are the reasoning)

Mirror `interpret_results` (targets improved/degraded, hypothesis_status **honestly** — partial is
PARTIAL, not SUCCESS; cross-PFT impact) and `extract_lesson` (is it a **discovery**? a **failed
approach**? a named pattern — Allocation Paradox, Perfect Storm, Mortality Trap?). Verify any
mechanism against RAG before asserting it.

## Step 3 — update Adaptive Memory (offline = curated, direct)

- **Vetted new discovery / failed approach you originated** → write it via `inject-knowledge`
  (interactive mode writes the curated JSON directly through `memory/manager.py`).
- **The online agent's staged proposals** (`auto_discovered_pending.json`) → review + promote/discard
  via `curate-knowledge` (`tools/review_pending_knowledge.py`). This is the Tier-3 write gate.

## Step 4 — decide where the loop goes (GATE on the middle-loop counter)

The online orchestrator enforces this fork in **code** (`orchestrator.py` state machine: `experiment_count`
vs `max_experiments`), so it physically cannot skip a cycle. **Offline you must enforce the SAME gate by
hand** — the offline agent matches or exceeds the online loop discipline, it never rushes past it. **Read
`experiment_count` / `skip_testing_count` from `workflow_state_offline_r{RR}.json` before deciding.**

**Structural objective gate (docs/34) — fill it, don't skip it.** Before recording a decision, populate the
`phase6_decision` block and run the validator; a failing check **blocks** the escalation (it cannot be the
path of least resistance):

```python
from tools.workflow_state_offline import WorkflowStateOffline
st = WorkflowStateOffline.load(calibration_round=RR)
st.set_phase6_decision(decision="rethink_6to3",           # converge | rethink_6to3 | redesign_6to0 | stop_model_dev
    objective="6 targets", best_so_far="3/6", binding_target="<the specific failing target>",
    next_targeted_experiment="<named, in-range, target-aimed experiment aimed at binding_target> | NONE",
    exhaustion_justification="<why no in-range experiment remains> | ''", max_experiments=10)
violations = st.validate_phase6_decision()   # MUST be [] before you act
```
`stop_model_dev` / `redesign_6to0` are rejected while `experiment_count < max_experiments` and a named
`next_targeted_experiment` remains (that is a `rethink_6to3`); `stop_model_dev` also requires
`next_targeted_experiment == NONE` + a non-empty `exhaustion_justification`. On `rethink_6to3`, advance the
counter via `st.set_position(experiment_count=experiment_count+1)` and `st.save()`.

- **All targets met** → converged (Phase 7); write the final config + round summary.
- **NOT met, `experiment_count` < `--max-experiments` (default 10)** → **6→3 rethink is the DEFAULT.** Do NOT
  escalate while the cycle budget remains. Before choosing anything other than rethink, confirm there is **no
  named, in-range, target-aimed parameter experiment left to run** ([[feedback_performance_experiment_is_the_objective]]);
  if one remains — including a lead flagged in a prior log — that **is** the next rethink cycle, run it.
  **On routing 6→3: increment `experiment_count` in the state file.**
- **NOT met, `experiment_count` = `--max-experiments`** (middle loop exhausted) → **6→0 redesign**: back to
  `phase0-design` with widened bounds; increment `calibration_round`. Redesign earlier is justified ONLY if
  every remaining candidate is a Morris-bound **edge** parameter (a redesign signal, not a Phase-4 knob) AND
  no in-range experiment remains — the exception, not the default.

> **"Stop → improve the model" is NOT a loop branch.** Modifying model source is *outside* the A2MC
> calibration loop; it is justified only after the loop is **provably exhausted** (rethink cycles to the cap,
> then redesign) OR a structural impossibility is **proven by exhausting the targeted experiments**, not
> asserted from one result. Jumping there with `experiment_count` cycles still on the clock is the rush this
> gate prevents.

## Step 5 — log, report, hand off

Log via `calibration-log` (phase log → `PhaseLogger.log_refinement`). Standardized reporting:
`summarize-calibration-round` (this round) / `compare-calibration-rounds` (vs prior). Then route per
Step 4. **Evidence gate (docs/33):** the refinement log must cite the evaluation artifact produced this
session (the biomass/target extraction + figure in `phase_results/{stem}/`); run
`python tools/check_offline_log_evidence.py <log.md>` (exit 0) before curating any lesson.

## Related skills / next phase

- **Curate staged proposals** → `curate-knowledge`. **Inject a vetted finding** → `inject-knowledge`.
- **Deeper investigation / figure** → `scientific-analysis`. **Round reports** →
  `summarize-calibration-round`, `compare-calibration-rounds`.
- **Next:** converged (Phase 7), or loop to `phase3-diagnosis` (rethink) / `phase0-design` (redesign).

## Changelog

- 2026-07-06: **Wired the middle-loop gate into Step 4.** The decision fork now gates on `experiment_count`
  vs `--max-experiments` (rethink 6→3 is the DEFAULT while cycles remain; redesign 6→0 only at the cap), adds
  the "no in-range target-aimed experiment left" precondition before any escalation, the counter-increment
  step, and an explicit "'stop → improve the model' is NOT a loop branch" guard. Mirrors the online
  orchestrator's coded state machine so the offline agent can't rush past the loop. Ported from demo `2d3f4b0`
  (v3.12), scrubbed of the Kougarok worked example. See `feedback_performance_experiment_is_the_objective`.
- 2026-07-02: Created — offline Phase 6 routine mirroring `interpret_results()` + `extract_lesson()`; encodes the offline "disposer" write gate (direct curated writes + promote staged proposals), delegates memory to curate-/inject-knowledge, reporting to summarize-/compare-calibration-round.
